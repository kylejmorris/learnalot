--- Study Card for Decolonization ---
Key historical topics for Decolonization:

1. Definition and causes of decolonization
2. Major waves of decolonization
3. Key figures in decolonization movements
4. Methods of achieving independence
5. Impacts on former colonies and colonizers
6. Cold War influences on decolonization
7. Neo-colonialism and its effects

Flash cards:

What is decolonization?::The process by which colonies gain independence from their colonizers

When did the main waves of decolonization occur?
?
1. Post-World War I (1918-1939): Dissolution of Ottoman and Austrian empires
2. Post-World War II (1945-1960s): Asian and African decolonization
3. Late 20th century: Fall of Soviet Union and dissolution of Yugoslavia

These waves were triggered by weakened imperial powers, rising nationalism, and international pressure for self-determination.

Three key figures in decolonization movements:::Mahatma Gandhi (India), Kwame Nkrumah (Ghana), and Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam)

Methods of achieving independence during decolonization
?
1. Peaceful negotiation: e.g., India's non-violent resistance led by Gandhi
2. Armed struggle: e.g., Algeria's war of independence against France
3. Unilateral declaration: e.g., Rhodesia's (now Zimbabwe) declaration in 1965

Each method had different outcomes and international responses, shaping the newly independent nations' futures.

Impact of decolonization on former colonies
?
1. Political restructuring: Formation of new governments, often unstable initially
2. Economic challenges: Loss of colonial economic support, need for new trade relationships
3. Social changes: Redefinition of national identity, language policies, education reforms

These impacts varied widely depending on the colony's resources, colonial legacy, and leadership.

How did the Cold War influence decolonization?
?
The Cold War significantly impacted decolonization by:
1. Creating a competition between the US and USSR for influence in newly independent nations
2. Providing economic and military aid to countries aligning with either superpower
3. Sometimes prolonging colonial control to prevent communist takeovers (e.g., in Vietnam)

This influence often led to proxy wars and political instability in decolonizing nations.

What is neo-colonialism?::Continued economic and cultural influence of former colonial powers over their previous colonies, despite formal political independence

Three examples of neo-colonial practices:::1. Economic control through multinational corporations 2. Cultural dominance through language and education 3. Political influence through foreign aid and debt

Bandung Conference (1955)
?
A meeting of Asian and African states, most of which were newly independent, that:
1. Promoted Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation
2. Opposed colonialism or neocolonialism by any nation
3. Laid the groundwork for the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War

This conference marked a significant moment in South-South cooperation and Third World solidarity.
